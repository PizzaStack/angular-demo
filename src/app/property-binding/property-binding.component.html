  Property binding is denoted by [] where we specify
  one-way-bindings to DOM properties and template expressions

  [propert] = "expression"

This is how you'd send notes to a child component:
<!--
<app-notes [notes]="notes"></app-notes>
-->

<div [ngStyle]="styleObject" (click)="changeBackgroundColor()">
<h2>Click me to change the color</h2>
</div>
